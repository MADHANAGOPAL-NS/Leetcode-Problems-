You are implementing a simplified version of Spotify’s Recently Played feature. Your task is to maintain a list of the last K unique songs played, following these rules:
1.
When a new song is played:
o
If it already exists in the list, move it to the front (most recently played position).
o
If it is new and the list has fewer than K songs, add it to the front.
o
If it is new and the list is full, remove the least recently played song (the last element in the list), then add the new song to the front.
Input Format
•
The first line contains an integer K — the maximum number of songs in the list.
•
The second line contains an integer N — the total number of songs played.
•
The third line contains N integers — the IDs of the songs played in the given order.
Output Format
•
Print the IDs of the songs in the list from the most recently played to the least recently played, separated by spaces.

Intution:
Input K → the maximum number of elements temp (cache) can store.

Initialize an empty list temp.

Iterate through each element in lst:
3.1. If temp is empty → directly append the current element.
3.2. Else if length of temp is less than or equal to k:
- If the current element is not in temp:
- Insert it at the front of temp.
- Else (element already in temp):
- Find its index.
- Insert the same element at the front.
- Remove the old occurrence from its previous position.
3.3. If after insertion, temp length exceeds k:
- Remove the last element in temp.

After the loop ends, print temp.
